### Security Policy

#### Supported Versions
We support the latest published version of `@curiousdev-oss/eslint-plugin-web-perf`.

#### Reporting a Vulnerability
- Do NOT open a public issue.
- Use GitHub Security Advisories: navigate to the repo and click "Report a vulnerability" to contact maintainers privately.
- If Security Advisories are unavailable, open an issue with only minimal details and request a private channel with `@curiousdev-oss`.

We aim to acknowledge valid reports within 72 hours and release fixes as soon as reasonably possible.
